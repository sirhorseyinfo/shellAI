# Shell AI
Shell AI is an AI written exclusively in shell script to run in the terminal. This project is more of a chellenge than a goal to change or make AI better. I understand that people have already tried this, I'm just trying to do something for fun rather than achieving something that hasn't been done before.
# Help and contribution
Though this is a personal challenge, I might end up needing help from other people. I'm not very smart, hence why I'm even trying this in the first place.
# Other Stuff
I want to make this AI favor coding questions rather than prompts like; 'Whats 2 times 2?' or 'What year did the french revolution happen?'.
# To-Do
* Figure out how to make this learn stuff
